                    Scouts are do-ers and give-it-a-go-ers. Yes, we go camping, hiking, swimming, abseiling,
                    cycling and canoeing. But we also get to hang out with our friends every week – having fun,
                    playing games, working in a team and taking on new challenges.
                </p>
                <p style="text-indent: 50px; color: #58277a">
                    Every week we give almost half a million 4-25 year olds the skills they need for school, college,
                    university, the job interview, the important speech, the tricky challenge and the big dreams: the
                    skills they need for life.

                    Everyone’s welcome here. All genders, races and backgrounds. Regardless of your child’s physical
                    ability – there’s a Scout adventure out there waiting for them. And we’ll help them find it.

                    Wearing a uniform is comfy and practical. It means no one feels uncomfortable or left out and helps
                    everyone feel part of the group.

                    Our uniform consists of a sweatshirt that you can sew badges on and a coloured scarf or 'necker’
                    to represent your local group. There're lots of other optional accessories you can wear such as
                    hats, hoodies, trousers or shorts.

                    A uniform can either be bought from our online shop -

                    where to start, leaders can give you more information about what to buy and where to buy it.
                    They may even know if someone is selling a uniform second hand. There may be grants
                    available locally to help you buy a uniform, ask your leader for more details.

                    Each group charges a fee (called subscriptions or subs) to cover the costs of running
                    regular meetings. This covers venue hire, insurances and materials for activities.
                    There're sometimes extra charges for special activities, camps and events. We try to keep
                    our subs as low as possible. so that anyone can come to Scouts. If you need help paying subs,
                    please speak to your leader.
